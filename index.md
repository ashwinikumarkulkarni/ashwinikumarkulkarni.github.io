<p id="details-text">I am a research scientist at the <a href="http://konopkalab.org">Prof. Genevieve Konopka Lab</a>, Department of Neuroscience, <a href="https://utsouthwestern.edu">UT Southwestern Medical Center</a>. Using next-generation sequencing at single cell resolutions coupled with computational and machine-learning approaches, I am studying the complex gene regulatory networks to identify genomic signatures involved in neurodevelopmental diseases, sleep and circadian regulation.</p>

<p id="details-text">I was born in Akola, Maharashtra, India. After completing my schoolwork and college in Amravati District in 2000, I entered Brijlal Biyani Science College, Amravati, India and earned a Bachelor’s degree in Science (B.Sc.). From 2003 to 2005, I attended Hislop School of Biotechnology, Nagpur, India for my Master’s degree (M.Sc.) in Biotechnology. Post M.Sc., I served as a Research Associate cum Faculty at Genecity Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Pune, India till 2008 and later as Executive - Research and Development at Yashraj Biotechnology Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India till 2009. In August 2009, I joined the Graduate School at the Department of Biological Science, UT Dallas first for my M.S. in Molecular and Cell Biology and later continued as a Ph.D. student under the mentorship of Prof. Michael Zhang. After completing my doctoral studies in December 2015, I joined the laboratory of <a href="http://konopkalab.org">Prof. Genevieve Konopka Lab</a> at the Department of Neuroscience, <a href="https://utsouthwestern.edu">UT Southwestern Medical Center</a>.</p>

<!-- **Sleep abnormalities are associated with long-term changes in brain function. The authors of this study investigated the transcriptional changes in frontal cortex that accompany sleep loss in mice in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of these plasticity changes. The key results reveal transcriptional mechanisms that underlie changes in brain function with sleep deprivation and strong functional evidence of a role for MEF2C in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and sleep homeostasis.** -->

Neuronal activity and gene expression in response to the loss of sleep can
provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated
with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC
frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow
wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s)
mediating the sleep loss response are not well understood. We show that
sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C
transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory
forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep
loss in C57BL/6J mice. These include altered gene expression, the increase and
recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which
implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.

Neuronal activity and gene expression in response to the loss of sleep can
provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated
with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC
frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow
wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s)
mediating the sleep loss response are not well understood. We show that
sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C
transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory
forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep
loss in C57BL/6J mice. These include altered gene expression, the increase and
recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which
implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.

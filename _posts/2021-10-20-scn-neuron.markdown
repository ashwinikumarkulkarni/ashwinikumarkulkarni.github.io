The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian pacemaker in
mammals and is entrained by environmental light. However, the molecular basis of the
response of the SCN to light is not fully understood. We used RNA/Chromatin
Immunoprecipitation/single-nucleus sequencing with circadian behavioral assays to
identify mouse SCN cell types and to explore their responses to light. We identified
three peptidergic cell types that responded to light in the SCN: (arginine vasopressin
[AVP], vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP], and cholecystokinin [CCK]). In each cell type,
light-responsive subgroups were enriched for expression of Neuronal PAS Domain
Protein 4 (NPAS4) target genes. Further, mice lacking Npas4 had a longer circadian
period in constant conditions, a damped phase response curve to light, and reduced
light-induced gene expression in the SCN. Together, our data indicate that NPAS4 is
necessary for normal transcriptional responses to light in the SCN and is critical for
photic phase-shifting of circadian behavior.

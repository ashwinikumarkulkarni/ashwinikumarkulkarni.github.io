Genetic studies have associated FOXP2 variation with speech and language
disorders and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) involving pathology of
the cortex. In this brain region, FoxP2 is expressed from development into
adulthood, but little is known about its downstream molecular and behavioral
functions. Here, we characterized cortex-specific Foxp2 conditional knockout
mice and found a major deficit in reversal learning, a form of behavioral
flexibility. In contrast, they showed normal activity levels, anxiety, and
vocalizations, save for a slight decrease in neonatal call loudness. These
behavioral phenotypes were accompanied by decreased cortical dopamine D1
receptor (D1R) expression at neonatal and adult stages, while general cortical
development remained unaffected. Finally, using single-cell transcriptomics, we
identified at least five excitatory and three inhibitory D1R-expressing cell
types in neonatal frontal cortex, and we found changes in D1R cell type
composition and gene expression upon cortical Foxp2 deletion. Strikingly, these
alterations included non-cell-autonomous changes in upper layer neurons and
interneurons. Together, these data support a role for Foxp2 in the development
of dopamine-modulated cortical circuits and behaviors relevant to NDDs.

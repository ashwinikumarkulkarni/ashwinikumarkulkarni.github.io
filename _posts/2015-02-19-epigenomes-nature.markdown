The reference human genome sequence set the stage for studies of genetic
variation and its association with human disease, but epigenomic studies lack a
similar reference. To address this need, the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium
generated the largest collection so far of human epigenomes for primary cells
and tissues. Here we describe the integrative analysis of 111 reference human
epigenomes generated as part of the programme, profiled for histone modification
patterns, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression. We establish
global maps of regulatory elements, define regulatory modules of coordinated
activity, and their likely activators and repressors. We show that disease- and
trait-associated genetic variants are enriched in tissue-specific epigenomic
marks, revealing biologically relevant cell types for diverse human traits, and
providing a resource for interpreting the molecular basis of human disease. Our
results demonstrate the central role of epigenomic information for understanding
gene regulation, cellular differentiation and human disease.

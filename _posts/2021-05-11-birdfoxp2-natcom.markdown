<!-- **Sleep abnormalities are associated with long-term changes in brain function. The authors of this study investigated the transcriptional changes in frontal cortex that accompany sleep loss in mice in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of these plasticity changes. The key results reveal transcriptional mechanisms that underlie changes in brain function with sleep deprivation and strong functional evidence of a role for MEF2C in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and sleep homeostasis.** -->

Disruption of the transcription factor FoxP2, which is enriched in the basal ganglia, impairs vocal development in humans and songbirds. The basal ganglia are important for the selection and sequencing of motor actions, but the circuit mechanisms governing accurate sequencing of learned vocalizations are unknown. Here, we show that expression of FoxP2 in the basal ganglia is vital for the fluent initiation and termination of birdsong, as well as the maintenance of song syllable sequencing in adulthood. Knockdown of FoxP2 imbalances dopamine receptor expression across striatal direct-like and indirect-like pathways, suggesting a role of dopaminergic signaling in regulating vocal motor sequencing. Confirming this prediction, we show that phasic dopamine activation, and not inhibition, during singing drives repetition of song syllables, thus also impairing fluent initiation and termination of birdsong. These findings demonstrate discrete circuit origins for the dysfluent repetition of vocal elements in songbirds, with implications for speech disorders.

Small-cell lung cancer and other aggressive neuroendocrine cancers are often
associated with early dissemination and frequent metastases. We demonstrate that
neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) is a regulatory hub securing cross talk
among survival and migratory-inducing signaling pathways in neuroendocrine lung
carcinomas. We find that NeuroD1 promotes tumor cell survival and metastasis in
aggressive neuroendocrine lung tumors through regulation of the receptor
tyrosine kinase tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB). Like TrkB, the
prometastatic signaling molecule neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is a
downstream target of NeuroD1, whose impaired expression mirrors loss of NeuroD1.
TrkB and NCAM may be therapeutic targets for aggressive neuroendocrine cancers
that express NeuroD1.

Epigenetic mechanisms have been proposed to play crucial roles in mammalian
development, but their precise functions are only partially understood. To
investigate epigenetic regulation of embryonic development, we differentiated
human embryonic stem cells into mesendoderm, neural progenitor cells,
trophoblast-like cells, and mesenchymal stem cells and systematically
characterized DNA methylation, chromatin modifications, and the transcriptome in
each lineage. We found that promoters that are active in early developmental
stages tend to be CG rich and mainly engage H3K27me3 upon silencing in
nonexpressing lineages. By contrast, promoters for genes expressed
preferentially at later stages are often CG poor and primarily employ DNA
methylation upon repression. Interestingly, the early developmental regulatory
genes are often located in large genomic domains that are generally devoid of
DNA methylation in most lineages, which we termed DNA methylation valleys
(DMVs). Our results suggest that distinct epigenetic mechanisms regulate early
and late stages of ES cell differentiation.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a promising approach to study the
transcriptomes of individual cells in the brain and the central nervous system
(CNS). This technology acts as a bridge between neuroscience, computational
biology, and systems biology, enabling an unbiased and novel understanding of
the cellular composition of the brain and CNS. Gene expression at the single
cell resolution is often noisy, sparse, and high-dimensional, creating
challenges for computational analysis of such data. In this review, we overview
fundamental sample preparation and data analysis processes of scRNA-seq and
provide a comparative perspective for analyzing and visualizing these data.

<!-- **Sleep abnormalities are associated with long-term changes in brain function. The authors of this study investigated the transcriptional changes in frontal cortex that accompany sleep loss in mice in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of these plasticity changes. The key results reveal transcriptional mechanisms that underlie changes in brain function with sleep deprivation and strong functional evidence of a role for MEF2C in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and sleep homeostasis.** -->

The hippocampus supports many facets of cognition, including learning, memory, and emotional processing. Anatomically, the hippocampus runs along a longitudinal axis, posterior to anterior in primates. The structure, function, and connectivity of the hippocampus vary along this axis. In human hippocampus, longitudinal functional heterogeneity remains an active area of investigation, and structural heterogeneity has not been described. To understand the cellular and molecular diversity along the hippocampal long axis in human brain and define molecular signatures corresponding to functional domains, we performed single-nuclei RNA sequencing on surgically resected human anterior and posterior hippocampus from epilepsy patients, identifying differentially expressed genes at cellular resolution. We further identify axis- and cell-type-specific gene expression signatures that differentially intersect with human genetic signals, identifying cell-type-specific genes in the posterior hippocampus for cognitive function and the anterior hippocampus for mood and affect. These data are accessible as a public resource through an interactive website.

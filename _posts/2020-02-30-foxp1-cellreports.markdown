The striatum is a critical forebrain structure integrating cognitive, sensory,
and motor information from diverse brain regions into meaningful behavioral
output. However, the transcriptional mechanisms underlying striatal development
at single-cell resolution remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq), we examine the cellular diversity of the early postnatal striatum and
show that Foxp1, a transcription factor strongly linked to autism and
intellectual disability, regulates the cellular composition, neurochemical
architecture, and connectivity of the striatum in a cell-type-dependent fashion.
We also identify Foxp1-regulated target genes within distinct cell types and
connect these molecular changes to functional and behavioral deficits relevant
to phenotypes described in patients with FOXP1 loss-of-function mutations. Using
this approach, we could also examine the non-cell-autonomous effects produced by
disrupting one cell type and the molecular compensation that occurs in other
populations. These data reveal the cell-type-specific transcriptional mechanisms
regulated by Foxp1 that underlie distinct features of striatal circuitry.
